### Hello!
My name is Tyler, and I am a 3rd year Computer Science student from Ontario, Canada. I am currently endeavoring toward my Honours Bachelor of Science, with a double specialization in software engineering and intelligent systems, while simultaneously preparing myself for a graduate degree in artifical intelligence and natural language processing. I am an avid JavaScript, TypeScript, Java, and SQL developer, a diligent student, and the right person you want on a team that's always innovating.

My research primarily focuses on common reasoning tasks and performance gains or drawbacks when utilizing typical methodology, including anthropomorphised methods such as decision trees and chains. My hope is to propose and implement solutions that leverage more of what we don't do as human beings - systems that utilize modular or hive thought with specialization embeddings that allow for a more piecewise breakdown of common tasks. At the conclusion of my BSc., I hope to become a PhD candidate in Intelligent Systems and Data Analysis.

## Research Interests
Over the next two years, under faculty supervision, I will be researching in two major areas:
- **Arithmetic Reasoning** - employing prior innovations (chain of thought, self-consistency, tree of thought) to create modular systems of specialized thought that rely on symbolic reasoning embedded in arithmetic operations; endeavoring towards the creation of a reasoning model and dataset that shows statistically significant performance gains over typical "two-dimensional" reasoning methods.
- **AI/Healthcare Intersection** - innovating on front-line technologies by implementing AI who can efficiently reduce the human burdens of therapeutic and rehabilitation work without directly replacing humans; augmenting the work of humans through AI applications such as dialogue summary, compassion-sensitive models, and working toward Turing-complete therapeutic models.
