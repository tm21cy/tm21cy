### Hello!
My name is Tyler, and I am a 3rd year Computer Science student from Ontario, Canada. I am currently endeavoring toward my Honours Bachelor of Science, with a double specialization in software engineering and intelligent systems, while simultaneously preparing myself for a graduate degree in artifical intelligence and natural language processing. I am an avid JavaScript, TypeScript, Java, and SQL developer, a diligent student, and the right person you want on a team that's always innovating.

## Research Interests
Over the next two years, under faculty supervision, I will be researching in two major areas:
- **Winograd Schema Challenge** - studying the effects of anaphoric inference & relative phrasing in large language models, including the employment of commonsense reasoning and natural language processing, and studying the history / solutions proposed to the WSC at large.
- **AI/Healthcare Intersection** - innovating on front-line technologies by implementing AI who can efficiently reduce the human burdens of therapeutic and rehabilitation work without directly replacing humans; augmenting the work of humans through AI applications such as dialogue summary, compassion-sensitive models, and working toward Turing-complete therapeutic models.

## Current development endeavors:<br><br>
**Information Technology Intern** @ Sigma Chi International Fraternity:
> - Serving as a 12-month intern for the Sigma Chi International Fraternity headquarters' IT Department, shadowing senior professionals, leading high-impact projects, and contributing to the teamâ€™s growth; all while elevating my interpersonal and professional skills through personalized mentoring, project management and professional development.

**Senior VP of Human Resources** / Incoming CIO @ School Simplified:
> - Coordination of the Human Resources Department and any automation tech surrounding daily operational capacity.<br>
> - Working with the Head of HR Information Systems as a direct report to implement new technology across the staff team.<br>
> - Databasing, relating, and making accessible the files of over 500 staff members, using MySQL, Azure, TypeScript, and Express.<br>
> - In the future, overseeing the operations of the Information Technology department, and collaborating on internal projects alongside 20+ department staff members.<br>
