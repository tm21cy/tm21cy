### Hello!
My name is Tyler - I'm a Master of Science student at Brock University, working towards my MSc in applied Natural Language Processing (NLP).

My research primarily focuses on the following core areas:
- **Regional LLM Biases:** given an LLM/LRM developed in a specific global region, are there specific cultural biases present in training data / RLHF procedures?
- **Quality Benchmarking:** many of our current benchmarks are saturated or do not appropriately study specific abilities in isolation - how can traditional, human-like tasks remedy this?
- **Cost Efficiency in NLP:** consumer-level techniques, like prompt engineering, bring quality and life to outputs, but at what cost to the end user? How can we faithfully measure these costs?

If you're interested in my work, please feel free to check out my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=7_B1Fh4AAAAJ&hl=en).

*Regrettably, I am unable to pursue internship/startup opportunities at this time.*
